Outfit automates the production of digital and print marketing materials with flexible, constraints-based templates.

I applied for the role as a Web Designer/Developer but from the interview the role I would attain became Customer Delivery Manager, as my skill-sets aligned well to leading and managing what would be the Delivery team of Outfit. 

Over the two years working at Outfit I have been promoted to Delivery Lead, grew the team from 2 to 13 internal members and from 3 to 11 external members (contractors, outsource developers, etc.). 

As the Delivery Lead, I managed the team in producing quality scoping collateral based on client briefs,  

Throughout this time, Outfit grew in size, increased revenue year on year and brought on more staff members
