During my time at Outfit, I served as the Delivery Lead, a role I transitioned into from initially applying as a Web Designer/Developer. My skills aligned perfectly with leading and managing what would become the Delivery team. Over two years, I was promoted from Customer Delivery Manager to Delivery Lead, growing the team from 2 to 15 internal members and from 3 to 11 external members, including contractors and outsource developers.

The role had me developing the skillsets of the team, ensuring they had lateral and progressive movement in the company and their careers. I worked closely with the Product and Tech teams to build a fulfilling product that served the teams who used the product. I spent much of my time with Customer Success and Sales in order to align best with clients and the funnel of Outfit's cashflow.
