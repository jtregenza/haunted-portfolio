As a predominatly digital creator, what you build is intagible. Taking up the hobby of wood working comes from an initial place of the tangible.

There is a form of relaxation of taking the raw materials and making something out of it.

## Craft work

Wood working is a craft, I don't think any one disputes that. I believe the same is said about design and so the skills, tactics, processes and improvisations are interchangable between both crafts, it is the tool and output that change and their alignment with the impact created.

## Trays for dices

In case you didn't know, I play Dnd, I'm sorry this is how you found out. I've intergrated my hobbies together to build dice trays so that my friends and I aren't throwing dice across the table. This involves making boxes, which is what the majority of wood working comes down to. This allows me to take my time to and be specfic with the type of wood and fabric used and how I can better my technique.


## Tables on Tables
More than anything though, I make tables, for my house specifically. I have made and remade our dinner table twice over, the first time paying closer attention to the table top (Chevron design) and the second making more sturdy legs for added stability. 

I might have a problem with scale though as my tables are over 1.8 metres. This aligns with the the fact that because I have the skill and ability to make a table, so I should make a table that I could otherwise not buy.
