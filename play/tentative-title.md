In 2023, my partner and I created Tentative Title. We are both creative and wanted to try our hand at taking our art: Her illustrations and my 3d art and produced lofi music to put behind it. 

This allowed us to make seamingly random art with intention. It wasn't a long lived project due to our busy lifestyle but a project that brought us together and working on something to each of our strengths.

I built out the brand for Tentative Title, aligning with a wabi sabi style and design patterns for 'tickets' so that it could be update and output rapidly. THe patterns allowed for different design iterations to work across a variety of motion and static images.
