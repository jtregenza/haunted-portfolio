  From the Archives, my trip to Lake Tahoe for Dan Petty's Montues trip"
---

“Are you alright?”
-----------------  
That’s what the young child called out to me as I raised my head up from the snow. I had taken a tumble whilst skiing down Northstar, Lake Tahoe. It was my last day skiing on this mountain.
“I’m better than alright, thank you for asking” I replied back to the child as they skied away.
How could I not be? I had not felt that lucky and fulfilled to be anywhere as I was right then and there. I was at Epicurrence: The Montues, after all. 

For those that don’t know, Epicurrence is a young series of events, put together by the warm-hearted and humble Dann Petty. It’s start came from Dann wanting to spend time with his design friends whilst snowboarding or surfing. Those events were small gatherings of 60–70 people and as an outsider seemed very exclusive and for the elite few.
The Montues is different, it’s aim was to expand the attendance to 300 and open it’s arms to a vast array of people in the industry from far and wide. It’s not a conference, it’s a gathering, a meeting of people from all around America and the world, with people travelling 16–20 hours to get there. It’s not a place where you go to pass out business cards or sell your latest food delivery app, it’s where people come together to listen and learn from each other, make fast friends and reenergise.

This is also an event where very real discussions about diversity can happen, something I’m really pleased to have occurred. It helped open people’s eyes on a lot of issues that we don’t often consider and put things into perspective. I hope more events, whether conferences or not, have this open and inclusive approach, it’s been a long time coming.  

When I was on the plane from Australia I did not feel like I should be going to this event. I didn’t feel like I was worthy of the invite. I’m just a guy with a growing aptitude for the craft. I’m not getting 100’s of likes on dribbble or speaking engagements about my workflow. I’m just a person trying to do his best in the world. The thing is, that is exactly the kind of people who were at the Montues. Whether they were design household names or heads of design teams. Everyone was there as just a person trying to do their best. It was an equalizer. Everyone’s story different, their struggles many. Their aspirations inspiring but all part of a community to support and enrich each other. 

Dann Petty outdid himself for us all, the man took on this challenge and pulled it off. His drive and capacity to create the impossible is a testament to him as a person. I know he has inspired many people to now go and strive for more, to be bold and enrich others lives. Hell he was also able to divine the heavens to give us the best days of snow Lake Tahoe has had in five years.

This event is not bridled by ego, it’s not full of the elite and the exclusive. The Montues is for everyone, no matter where you are in life right now. If you can make the time to go it to one of the Epicurrence events I implore you to go. If you need a hand, reach out to myself or many other who went. I know I wouldn’t want someone to miss out on the experiences that I have had whilst in the mountains of Lake Tahoe. 

The pang of the #monblues feels like falling into fresh snow after rushing down a slope. Just like I was when I took a tumble, I’m feeling better than alright. I got to meet all the people that I did. I was able to listen to them, hear their stories. I got to feel for the first time that I was part of the larger design community. I’m humbled that I was there, to feel the stoke that Epicurrence provides.
